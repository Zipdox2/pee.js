# What is it?
Pee.js is a library for leaking a set amount of memory, written in JavaScript.

## Why does this exist?
I wanted to make a JavaScript library named pee.js because of a typo and a pun.

## Usage
```js
import { leak } from './pee.js';
leak(69); // Leaks 69 MB of memory
```

## Why should I care?
You should not. Thank you for your time.
