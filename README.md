# What is it?
Pee.js is a library for leaking a set amount of memory, written in JavaScript.

## Why does this exist?
I wanted to make a JavaScript library named pee.js because of a typo and a pun.

## Usage

### Browser (pee.js)
```js
import { leak } from './pee.js';
leak(69); // Leaks 69 MB of memory
```

### Node
```console
npm install pee.js # This does not exist just yet, it will soon!
```
```js
const pee = require('pee.js');
pee.leak(420);
```
See `test/test.node.js` for a more in-depth example
